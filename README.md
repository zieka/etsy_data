# Etsy Data

## Summary
I have scraped some info off of approx 30,000 etsy stores which can be foudn in the raw data directory.
I created a cleaning script which removes some of the crawler specific columns and cleans the data up for analysis.
I then created a shiny app to allow for some exploratory analysis of the data, including k-means clusterings!
Enjoy!
