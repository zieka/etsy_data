# Etsy Data

## Summary
I have scraped some info off of approx 30,000 etsy stores.  I intend to play with this data to see if we can find any cool trends and possibly build a cool predictor.

## TODO list

* write script to clean up dataset
    - fill in missing data with NA
    - `etsy[,c(7,9,10,11,12,13)]`
    - add calculated column for age in days: 3/18/2015 - open date (column 9)

* Exploratory analysis
    - plot
    - ggpairs
